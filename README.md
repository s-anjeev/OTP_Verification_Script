## Overview
This Python script demonstrates a basic One-Time Password (OTP) generation and validation system. It uses the pyotp library to generate OTPs and the Vonage API to send OTPs to users via SMS. The script then prompts the user to enter the received OTP, validates it, and grants access if the OTP is valid and within the time limit.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following:
Python 3.x installed
Required Python packages installed (pyotp, vonage)
Vonage API key and secret for sending SMS (replace placeholders in the script)

## Usage
Run the script: python otp_script.py
Enter the user's contact number (10 digits) when prompted.
The script will generate an OTP, send it to the user via SMS using the Vonage API, and prompt the user to enter the received OTP.
Enter the OTP within the allowed time limit.
The script will validate the entered OTP and grant access if it's valid.

## Notes
The script sets an expiration time for OTPs (default: 5 minutes). Adjust the expiration threshold as needed.
Replace Vonage API key and secret with your own credentials for SMS functionality.
The script includes error handling for input validation and maximum OTP entry attempts.
